      What is Particulate Matter (PM)? 1.1 Why does particle size matter 1.2 How
      are particles formed? 1.3 Which materials are the main components of
      particulate matter? Particulate matter is the sum of all solid and liquid
      particles suspended in air many of which are hazardous. This complex
      mixture includes both organic and inorganic particles, such as dust,
      pollen, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. These particles vary greatly in
      size, composition, and origin. Particles in air are either: directly
      emitted, for instance when fuel is burnt and when dust is carried by wind,
      or indirectly formed, when gaseous pollutants previously emitted to air
      turn into particulate matter.
